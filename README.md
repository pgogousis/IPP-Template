Benchmarking Graph Data Processing Systems Project Proposal

# Abstract

The aim of this project is to examine state-of-the-art graph processing systems and com-pare their performance and scalability in both local and parallel settings.  More specifically,the project focuses on showing that often times scalability comes at a cost,  and in manycases such an approach is not worth the time and effort.  In this research project we willprove this by conducting several experiments that will demonstrate that a single-core set-upoutperforms executions on multi-core environments due to the parallelization overhead that incurs.
